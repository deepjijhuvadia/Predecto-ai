## Future Insight Predictor

This Streamlit application helps you predict future values based on historical data in a CSV file. It offers various machine learning algorithms to choose from and provides informative visualizations to assess model performance.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
  - Python 3.x
  - Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
  - Pandas: `pip install pandas`
  - scikit-learn: `pip install scikit-learn`
  - matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
  - seaborn: `pip install seaborn`

2. **Run the app:**
  - Save the code as `app.py`.
  - Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file, and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

### How it Works

1. Upload a CSV file containing your historical data.
2. The app will display a preview of the data.
3. Preprocessing is applied to format the data for modeling.
4. Select the features (independent variables) and target variable (dependent variable) for prediction.
5. Choose a prediction task based on your data domain (e.g., Stock Sale, Real Estate Prices).
6. Select a machine learning algorithm for prediction.
7. Click "Train and Evaluate" to train the model and view the results.

### Output

- The predicted value for the next month.
- Model accuracy score and cross-validation scores for evaluation.
- Visualization comparing actual vs predicted values, highlighting overestimations and underestimations.

### Note

This is a basic implementation and can be further enhanced with additional features and functionalities based on your specific needs.
